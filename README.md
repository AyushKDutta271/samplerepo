I've made AI-Code review bot for reviewing any code-files that will work in any directory that's inside git-working-tree and I also made AI pre commit hook  bot which will be automatically called by git itself whenever we will try to do commit. It will check if the changes that we added in staging are correct to get commited or should be corrected first before committing to git. I've made all this using Cline CLI sponsor tool.
